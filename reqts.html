Sensor data collection
	This refers to the function that collects sensor data from different sensors based on a-predefined schedule.

Sensor data transfer
	This refers to the function that transfer sensor data the back-end server on a cloud.

Smart Node control by Smart Cluster
	This refers to the basic control functions, such as node creation, update, deletion as well as status change.
	The Smart Cluster controls and supports a number of smart nodes, and collect sensor data from them, and send sensor data to the back-end server.

Smart Node configuration
	This supports the configuration of a smart node, including add/delete/update/set-up a list of sensors. For each sensor, it has the following status: Turn-On, Active, Inactive, Turn-Off, and Maintenance

Sensor Methods
getData()
	returns data that will be sent to main processing server
getType()
	get sensor type of the sensor
getValueDataType()
	get the the value of the data along with its type
getSensorStatus()
	get the status of the sensor
simulateSensorStatus()
	simulate the status of the sensor

SmartNode Methods
getSensors()
	returns list of sensors
getAllSensorData
	returns list of data from sensors associated with this node
getSensorData(sensorId)
	returns sensor data for an inputted sensor id
sendData()
	returns data that will be sent to main processing server
addSensor(sensor)
	add a sensor by inputting its id
addSensors(sensors[])

Smart Cluster Controller
addNode(node)
	adds a SmartNode
removeNode(node)
	removes a SmartNode
postData(buildingId, controllorId) 
	send data to server, server first checks if this node is registered in building part of db, if it is it will update its smart nodes with info)
getAllSensorData() 
	returns sensor data from all nodes
getStatus()
	returns status of controller
simulateStatus()
	returns simulated status response
simulateSensorData(sensorId)
	simulates sensor data
simulateNodeData(nodeId)
	simulates SmartNode data
getNodes()
	returns a list of SmartNodes belonging to this SmartCluster
changeNodeStatus(nodeId, status)
	change the status of a SmartNode by id and status
updateNode(nodeId, floorNumber, roomNumber)
	update the SmartNode properties
